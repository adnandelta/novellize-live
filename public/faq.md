Is Novellize free to use?
 Absolutely. We do not charge users anything.


Do I need an account to read novels?
You can browse without an account, but creating one allows you to track your novels, rate and follow the novel or author, and receive personalized recommendations. Doing so also gives you the privilege to add a novel to your library and engage in our community.

Can I remove or edit my uploaded content?
Yes! You can edit your content anytime to update details, fix errors, or improve your listing.
If you want to remove your content, your request will go to a moderator for approval before it is taken down. This ensures proper content management and prevents accidental deletions.
Are there any restrictions on what I can post?
Yes. Please ensure that your content falls within the accepted categories listed in our content guidelines. Any content that does not fit into the approved novel or comic categories may not be accepted.
Additionally, make sure your uploads comply with copyright rules and do not include prohibited or inappropriate material. For more details on what is allowed, please check FAQ No. 19.
Can I schedule chapter releases?
Not yet! This feature is currently a work in progress (WIP), but we‚Äôre working on adding it soon to make uploading even more convenient for authors and uploaders. Stay tuned for updates!
How do I credit my team (editors, proofreaders, translators, etc.)?
When you list your novel or comic, you will have an option at the end to add usernames of the people you want to credit. If multiple people contributed to the same role, you can separate their names with a comma. This ensures that every team member receives proper recognition.
Currently, we support credits for 12 categories of contributors, including Series Artists, Translators, Editors, Proofreaders, Posters, Raw Providers, Art Directors, Drafters, Line Artists, Color Artists, Compositors, and Typesetters.
If there‚Äôs a role that isn‚Äôt listed, feel free to suggest an addition through the suggestion box on the forum page. We‚Äôre always open to improving the platform based on community feedback!

By clicking on a book, you can view detailed engagement statistics, including views, follows, likes, and other interaction metrics.

Are there monetization options for authors?
Not yet! This feature is currently a work in progress (WIP), but we‚Äôre working on adding it soon to make uploading even more convenient for authors and uploaders. Stay tuned for updates!
What happens if my novel gets reported?
If your novel gets reported, it will be sent to a moderator for review and will be temporarily hidden from the audience. The moderator will then determine whether the report is valid.
If the report is unfair, your novel will be restored as usual, and the user who falsely reported it may receive a warning.
If the report is valid, the novel will be blacklisted permanently, and you will receive a warning regarding the violation.

Can I collaborate with other authors on a project?
Yes! If all participating authors mutually agree, you can collaborate on a novel or webcomic. Each collaborator can be credited properly in the Author Console, and contributions can be managed collectively.
Currently, all uploads and edits are handled through a single uploader account, so it‚Äôs recommended to coordinate with your co-authors on updates and management. Future updates may include a dedicated collaboration feature to streamline co-authoring!
How do I handle fan translations of my work?
If you, as the author, are okay with fan translations, we can help facilitate the process on our platform and even connect you with fans interested in translating your work.
However, if you do not approve of fan translations and someone is uploading them without your consent, especially on our platform, we can assist you in contacting the translator to either remove the content or reach a mutual agreement. Our goal is to respect authors‚Äô rights while supporting community-driven translations.
