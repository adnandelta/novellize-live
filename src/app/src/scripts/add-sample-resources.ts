- All-knowing narrator
- Can show multiple perspectives
- Requires careful handling

### Second Person
- Rarely used but powerful
- Creates unique reader experience
- Best for experimental fiction

## Choosing the Right POV
Consider your story's needs:
- How much should the reader know?
- Which character has the most compelling voice?
- What serves the plot best?

## Common POV Mistakes
1. Head-hopping within scenes
2. Inconsistent voice
3. Wrong POV for the story type
4. Mixing tenses carelessly

## Exercises

    title: "Dialogue Writing Mastery",
    description: "Learn to write natural, engaging dialogue that reveals character and advances your plot.",
    content: `# Dialogue Writing Mastery

## What Makes Good Dialogue?
Great dialogue serves multiple purposes: reveals character, advances plot, and sounds natural.

## Key Principles

### 1. Each Character Has a Unique Voice
- Consider education level
- Regional dialects or accents
- Age and generation
- Personality traits
- Professional background

### 2. Subtext is Everything
Characters rarely say exactly what they mean. The real conversation happens beneath the surface.

### 3. Conflict Creates Interest
Even friendly conversations should have some tension or disagreement.

## Dialogue Techniques

### Show Don't Tell Through Speech
- Bad: "I'm angry at you."
- Good: "Fine. Whatever you say."

### Use Action Beats
- "I can't believe this." She slammed the door.
- He shrugged. "Suit yourself."

### Vary Speech Patterns
- Short, clipped responses for tension
- Longer speeches for exposition or emotion
- Interruptions for realism

## Common Dialogue Mistakes
1. On-the-nose dialogue (saying exactly what they mean)
2. Info-dumping through conversation
3. All characters sound the same
4. Too much small talk
5. Overusing dialogue tags

## Dialogue Tags and Beats
- Use "said" most of the time
- Avoid adverbs (whispered softly)
- Mix dialogue tags with action beats
- Don't tag every line

## Reading Your Dialogue Aloud
- Does it sound natural?
- Can you hear each character's voice?
- Are there natural pauses and rhythms?
- Does it move the story forward?

## Exercises
1. Eavesdrop and transcribe real conversations
2. Write dialogue without any tags or beats
3. Give each character a unique speech pattern
4. Practice writing subtext-heavy scenes

Remember: Great dialogue is realism, not reality. It's more focused and purposeful than real speech.`,
