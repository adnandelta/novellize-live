  {
    question: "Who can upload content?",
    answer: "Anyone who has a published work or is starting to publish now! To upload content on Novellize, you need to request author access. This feature is available to registered users who wish to share their stories with the community. If you're not the author but wish to list your favorite book here, you can also request uploader access. Just don't forget to tag the author and let them know so they can take advantage of author privileges!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do I create an author page?",
    answer: "To create an author page, you first need to request author access. This feature is available to registered users who want to share their stories and engage with their audience. Once you have author access, you can navigate to the 'Create Author Page' section in your profile settings. Here, you can: Add a bio to introduce yourself, Upload a profile picture or banner, List your works with direct links, Share updates & announcements for your followers, and Engage with readers through comments and discussions. Your author page helps fans follow your journey, stay updated on your works, and interact with you directly!"
  },
  {
    question: "What types of content can I upload?",
    answer: "On Novellize, you can upload novels or comics, whether they are original works, translations (with proper credits and permissions), or fan fiction. Whether you're an author sharing your own story, a translator bringing amazing content to a wider audience, or a fan creating something inspired, we welcome all kinds of contributions! You can upload content in various styles and formats, including light novels, published novels, web novels/webtoons, graphic novels, novellas, short stories, serialized and episodic novels, epistolary novels, anthologies, choose-your-own-adventure books, and novels-in-verse. Additionally, you can upload cover art and extra illustrations to enhance your novel or comic's presentation and make it more engaging for readers."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upload images, covers, and extra art?",
    answer: "Yes! Novellize allows you to upload images, covers, and extra art to enhance your novel or comic. You can add: Cover images to represent your work, Extra illustrations to showcase character designs, scenes, or concept art, and Promotional banners for better visibility. Make sure that the images you upload are high quality and comply with copyright guidelines. If you're uploading artwork that isn't yours, be sure to have permission from the original artist and give proper credit."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I make announcements?",
    answer: "Yes! You can create an announcement on your author page or in the community section. Once you submit your announcement, it will go to a moderator for approval. Once approved, it will be officially announced and visible to your followers and the community."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I remove or edit my uploaded content?",
    answer: "Yes! You can edit your content anytime to update details, fix errors, or improve your listing. If you want to remove your content, your request will go to a moderator for approval before it is taken down. This ensures proper content management and prevents accidental deletions."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any restrictions on what I can post?",
    answer: "Yes. Please ensure that your content falls within the accepted categories listed in our content guidelines. Any content that does not fit into the approved novel or comic categories may not be accepted. Additionally, make sure your uploads comply with copyright rules and do not include prohibited or inappropriate material."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I schedule chapter releases?",
    answer: "Not yet! This feature is currently a work in progress (WIP), but we're working on adding it soon to make uploading even more convenient for authors and uploaders. Stay tuned for updates!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do I credit my team?",
    answer: "When you list your novel or comic, you will have an option at the end to add usernames of the people you want to credit. If multiple people contributed to the same role, you can separate their names with a comma. Currently, we support credits for 12 categories of contributors, including Series Artists, Translators, Editors, Proofreaders, Posters, Raw Providers, Art Directors, Drafters, Line Artists, Color Artists, Compositors, and Typesetters. If there's a role that isn't listed, feel free to suggest an addition through the suggestion box on the forum page."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track my novel's engagement?",
    answer: "Yes! In the Author Console, you'll find a list of all the books you are the author of or have uploaded. By clicking on a book, you can view detailed engagement statistics, including views, follows, likes, and other interaction metrics. This helps you track your novel's performance and understand your audience better."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there monetization options for authors?",
    answer: "Not yet! This feature is currently a work in progress (WIP), but we're working on adding it soon to make uploading even more convenient for authors and uploaders. Stay tuned for updates!"
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my novel gets reported?",
    answer: "If your novel gets reported, it will be sent to a moderator for review and will be temporarily hidden from the audience. The moderator will then determine whether the report is valid. If the report is unfair, your novel will be restored as usual, and the user who falsely reported it may receive a warning. If the report is valid, the novel will be blacklisted permanently, and you will receive a warning regarding the violation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I collaborate with other authors?",
    answer: "Yes! If all participating authors mutually agree, you can collaborate on a novel or webcomic. Each collaborator can be credited properly in the Author Console, and contributions can be managed collectively. Currently, all uploads and edits are handled through a single uploader account, so it's recommended to coordinate with your co-authors on updates and management. Future updates may include a dedicated collaboration feature to streamline co-authoring!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do I handle fan translations of my work?",
    answer: "If you, as the author, are okay with fan translations, we can help facilitate the process on our platform and even connect you with fans interested in translating your work. However, if you do not approve of fan translations and someone is uploading them without your consent, especially on our platform, we can assist you in contacting the translator to either remove the content or reach a mutual agreement. Our goal is to respect authors' rights while supporting community-driven translations."
