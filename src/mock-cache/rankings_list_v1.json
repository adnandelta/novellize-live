A soul from the future, unexpectedly transported back in time, finds himself thrust into the highest office of the land, Prime Minister of a nation on the cusp of rebirth.\n\nWhat follows is a journey through the corridors of power, where betrayal lurks at every corner, and internal strife threatens to tear the fledgling nation apart. Faced with impossible choices, this modern mind must navigate a country marked by political intrigue, international pressures, and the weight of a people’s hopes.\n\nBut beneath the surface lies a larger ambition, the vision of an Akhand Bharat, a united and unshakable India that rises from the ashes of its tragic past to forge a bold new future.\n\nAs history begins to unravel and destiny is rewritten, the stakes grow ever higher. What will it take to unify a divided land and bring forth a nation powerful enough to redefine its place on the global stage? In a tale of courage, sacrifice, and the power of leadership, witness the birth of \"A New India\" unlike any before, a force to be reckoned with, ready to stand among the world’s greats.",

Violence and years of trauma hardened them, while secrets and promises bonded them. What will happen when they cross paths with the pack known for destroying Rogues and conquering the weak? Will the mate bond twist their plans or lead them further down the path of darkness? Is there any salvation for the damned? Only the Moon Goddess knows...\n\n-\n\n\"What is your name? Why is your wolf black?\"\n\n\"It's...not...important.\"\n\nThree more. My head began to lull forward as my neck could no longer hold the weight. He walked around with thundering footsteps and grabbed my head by my wet curls. He pulled my head back until he could see my face, taunting me with a dark smile and eyes full of delight.\n\n\"Why don't you carry a scent? Who are you?\"\n\nI gave him a bloody smile as my eyes started to close, darkness singing its siren song beneath the ringing in my ears.\n\n\"I thought...you'd...never ask,\" I panted out weakly as I let Enyo penetrate the room with our scent.\n\n\"I'm...your...mate,\" I added before passing out, welcoming the darkness like an old, missed friend.\n\n-\nMost impressive ranking:\n#1 in werewolf, #4 in Lycan, #1 in Slow, #4 in Gory\n\nNotes from the Author:\n\nIf you are looking for a story that leans more on slow-burning, plot-building themes with multiple moving forces that are not solely centered around the straightforward mate bond romance, then start reading! **Strong language and vivid imagery are scattered throughout**",

      "synopsis": "Zi Haoran, a man of formidable ambition and pride, finds himself at the crossroads of destiny. Once a towering figure of power and prestige, he now faces the crumbling remnants of his empire, his love, and his identity. The love of his life, Han Xue whose heart was once tender, is now shielded by indifference, hardened by the wounds of their fractured marriage and his mistakes. Yet, just as the darkness threatens to consume him, destiny offers him an unexpected opportunity—not as mercy, but as a challenge.  \n\nThis time, Zi Haoran is not only fighting for his wife’s love. He’s reclaiming his throne, his honor, and vengeance against those who conspired against him. As newfound strength surges within him, powers he never imagined begin to awaken, reshaping him into a man even he cannot recognize.\n\nAs Zi Haoran embraces this path, his every step seems guided by an uncanny certainty, his power growing sharper and his charisma more irresistible. With each encounter, Han Xue finds it harder to ignore the man who now stands before her—charming, persistent, and surprisingly vulnerable.  \n\n\n---------------------\n\n\nZi Haoran stepped into the living room just as Han Xue tried to leave. His hand shot out, catching her wrist gently but firmly. She turned to glare at him.\n\n“Why now, Zi Haoran?” she demanded, her voice sharp. “Why try to fix what you shattered?”\n\nHe pulled her closer, his gaze steady. “Because,” he said softly, “some things are worth breaking myself to rebuild.”\n\nBefore she could respond, he tugged her down onto his lap, his arms circling her securely. She gasped, her eyes widening as she struggled against him. “Let me go!”\n\n“Not until you hear me out,” he said firmly, his teasing grin softening his words.\n\n“Why do you keep trying?” she asked, her voice exasperated as she pushed at his chest.\n\n“Because you’re worth it,” he replied, his confidence maddening. “And, let’s face it, you’ve missed me.”\n\nHer cheeks flushed as she shoved harder. “You’re delusional.”\n\n“Maybe,” he murmured, leaning closer, his breath brushing her cheek, “but you didn’t say I was wrong.”\n\nFlustered, she finally broke free, stepping back as she glared at him. “You’re wasting your time. I don’t feel the same anymore,” she snapped.\n\nWithout warning, he leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to her cheek, his voice low and playful as he stepped back. “You’ll feel again. You’ll see… I’ve only just begun.”\n\nHer hand flew to her cheek, her eyes blazing with confusion and anger. She turned abruptly and fled the room, leaving Zi Haoran standing there, his smirk fading as he watched her retreat, bewildered by the turmoil he’d stirred.\n\n\n----------------------\n\n\nWhat confounds her most is not just his persistence, but the fire in his eyes—something deeper, as if he knows more than he should, perhaps even the secrets hidden in time itself.\n\nAs Han Xue struggles to reconcile this transformed man with the one she once knew, the world shifts around them. His newfound powers, coupled with his sharp mind and commanding presence, turn him into a man of unparalleled strength. Every step he takes to win her heart back is also a step toward reclaiming the world he let slip through his fingers.  \n\nWith destiny pulling the strings, will Han Xue’s resistance hold, or will her resolve melt before the man she once loved—and the one he is becoming? One thing is certain: destiny desires nothing less than complete metamorphosis, for love, power, and vengeance.\n",

      "synopsis": "Penny has three brothers: one is a billionaire CEO, the second is the youngest military lieutenant, and the last is a successful actor. \n\nThese three successful men had only one common ground: bullying Penny, their sore-eye of a little sister. The sister they never wished to have, and the one who claimed to be their real sister, while the sister they treasured all this time was a fake. \n\nAfter living a life of maltreatment in her aunt's home, some people of high standing came to Penny with news of her real parentage. She thought she was finally saved from her aunt’s clutches, unaware that what awaited her was worse. \n\nAt 13, Penny only wished for one thing: for her brothers to love her and treat her like family, just as much as they loved their fake sister. She worked and studied ten times harder than anybody else just to be accepted by them. In her desperation, she foolishly fell into a trap set by a malicious person, not knowing her actions would result in the downfall of her brothers and her ending up in jail with a death sentence. \n\nOn her execution day, Penny had only one thought in mind: \n\nIf she ever got to go back in time, her brothers could pamper their fake sister for all she cared! She wanted nothing to do with them! And much to her surprise, Penny found herself back on the day it all began: the day she was born. \n\nAs promised, this time, she wouldn’t foolishly try to earn her brothers' love and affection. Never mind family! She’d just make a lot of money, live in luxury, and make a family of her own! \n\nBut wait, why is it now that she didn’t want anything to do with her brothers, they kept poking their noses into her business? Weren’t they supposed to pamper their fake sister? Why won’t they leave her alone?! \n\nAnd how on earth was she married in this lifetime? To make matters worse, this husband she never had in her first life was suddenly volunteering to be the father of her children?!",

      "synopsis": "At her wedding banquet, a man claiming to be Selina's lover stormed in, brandishing so-called intimate photos and causing chaos. \n\nSelina immediately saw through this as a scheme orchestrated by her half-sister, Natalia. However, Selina's fiancé, Ryan, not only refused to believe her but also went out of his way to defend Natalia. \n\nIt turned out that Ryan and Natalia had already developed feelings for each other in secret. Everyone—Selina's father, stepmother, and Ryan's parents—knew about their affair, except for Selina, who was left in the dark. \n\nTaking advantage of the situation, Selina's father suggested swapping brides, proposing that Natalia replace Selina and complete the wedding. Ryan's family not only didn’t object but wholeheartedly supported the idea. \n\nThat was the moment Selina finally realized the cruel truth: her family and Ryan's family were nothing but wolves in sheep’s clothing! \n\n\"Cancel the engagement? Fine. But let it be clear—I’m the one rejecting you, you two-timing, spineless excuse for a man!\" Selina declared with unshakable confidence. \n\nHer gaze then swept across the room, landing on an elegant and distinguished man. She vaguely remembered him as Ryan’s younger uncle. Walking over, she boldly asked, \"Sir, how about getting married?\" \n\nThe man raised an eyebrow, finding her audacity intriguing. \"It would be my honor, madam,\" he replied. \n\n...",

      "synopsis": "Mercedes Kerunu is orphaned by mysterious and absurd circumstances and so begins her research into those events, trying to discover why her family died in a small refinery town on Mercury.\n\nShe follows the trail of two genius inventors across the solar system trying to unwind the exotic happenstances occurring all around.\n\nThe only other site this is on is RoyalRoad. Anywhere else is not there with my permission.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\nAn intelligent protagonist who makes quick choices, not always to best choices though. She'll be a bit too prideful at the start, but don't worry, everyone gets their due in this story.\n\nA host of intelligent antagonists and villains, because the idiot ball is heavy and we don't have time to workout. I don't like it when a villain is antagonistic just to act as an obstacle to the story.\n\nNot just one ludicrously overpowered character who acts as the hand behind the curtain. Destiny is a tapestry where others weave with you.\n\nSecrets abound. There a metric ton of secrets hidden throughout the story. Not references to funny things, those don't count as secrets. Real hidden details that sprinkle in unnecessary but still awesome world building, and sometimes foreshadow events to come. Encore.\n\nMultiple arcs, each one exploring a planet and how it has been changed by the geniuses. This will be the basic story structure, wherein the arrival / subsequent departure of the planets mark that arc's ending.\n\nNo dumb boring power scaling, when a character becomes more powerful it isn't just to beat this one new hurdle and then power up again for the next one. We've got consequences and shenanigans galore.\n\nA sci-fi world succumbing to magic and might. Not in the way you think, there will be no elves in this story, nor any mention of mana and other classical fantasy. We're dealing with the real shit, like wiggling your fingers and some pie appears.\n\nBanana bread. (No really, it's important.)\n\nSecret Identities for a myriad of characters. Dramatic irony fuels my core.\n\nGods, but not many other mythos tropes. This is called Nascent Divinity after all, the myths are just being made.\n\nTragic arcs and ending, but with catharsis. I tried to put my fears into certain characters throughout the story, and I think it worked out pretty well.\n\nNo info dump chapters because I like to keep the plot flowing. Some moments might provide a bit of exposition but never a long slog of world building thrust into your hands, that's boring.\n\nA horribly inconsistent upload schedule as my focus is abysmal. Inspiration comes in waves but leaves a drought, you know how it is.\n\nModest 2k word chapter length on average but some might go for much longer. I'll try to keep the objective of chapter length \"fitted to the plot\" so I won't squish or stretch important moments to get a decent length.\n\nNever stubbing as I don't know if I'll even finish, and if I do it'll be nice to have a free work under my name.",
